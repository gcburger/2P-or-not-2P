# 2P-or-not-2P

A 2-player puzzle game developed using Unreal Engine 5.3.2

The game is designed to be played by 2 players. Each session allows 2 players to connect. The first 4 puzzles of
the game are designed to be completed by one player (single-player mode), while the next 5 puzzles require
two players in order to complete them (cooperative multiplayer mode). While playing with voice chat is
technically not required, it is recommended that both players communicate verbally during the cooperative
multiplayer puzzles using an application of their choosing (as it can enhance the experience).
